This does not work for me, because I couldnt find a way to solve a problem with the zoom (every time I use the zoom, it copies the lines several times - see example -).

Basically what I need to do is to read in realtime some coordinate files (for that I use Leaflet.Liveupdate), and then display the line with some requirements.

The most important requirement is that the line needs to be with a real scalable width (like a corridor or a buffer -  https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/leaflet-corridor ).
I think that is were I get the problem with the zoom and motion.

But may be this can help you with your project.
